# PiSensors_Homeassistant
I added this existing monitor/control script to Home Assistant with a few mods it was originally intended for use with aplant growing automation etc
it now drives 2 relays and  I have left some other GPIO data returned via MQTT The Dietpi platform is perfect for these type of projects.
